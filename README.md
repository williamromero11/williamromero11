## 👨‍💻 Security Labs & Competitions

### [Linux Active Directory & System Administration Lab](https://github.com/williamromero11/linux-active-directory-lab) | November 2025
A hands-on lab simulating enterprise identity and access management in a multi-server virtualized environment. This hands-on lab demonstrates the deployment and management of a Linux-based Active Directory environment in a virtualized, multi-server setup. Using Samba AD, Kerberos, DNS, and NTP, I configured a domain controller to simulate enterprise-level identity and access management. The project emphasized security best practices, including least-privilege access, automated administration via Bash and PowerShell scripts, and validation of directory services through structured testing. This lab reflects practical skills in system administration, security hardening, and infrastructure automation — core competencies for roles in cybersecurity, IT operations, and cloud administration.

### [HACK@UCF Cyber Challenge CTF](https://hackucf.org/ctf) | February 2025  
A scenario-based cybersecurity competition simulating real-world enterprise breach investigation and incident response under time-constrained conditions. This Capture The Flag challenge required practical application of network reconnaissance, service enumeration, and forensic analysis techniques to identify compromised systems and recover critical data flags. The competition emphasized rapid threat assessment, systematic investigation methodologies, and adherence to incident response protocols while working within competitive time constraints. This experience demonstrates applied skills in defensive security operations, threat hunting, and real-time problem-solving — valuable competencies for roles in SOC analysis, incident response, and penetration testing.
