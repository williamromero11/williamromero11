## 👨‍💻 Projects

### [Linux Active Directory & System Administration Lab](https://github.com/williamromero11/linux-active-directory-lab)
A hands-on lab simulating enterprise identity and access management in a multi-server virtualized environment. This hands-on lab demonstrates the deployment and management of a Linux-based Active Directory environment in a virtualized, multi-server setup. Using Samba AD, Kerberos, DNS, and NTP, I configured a domain controller to simulate enterprise-level identity and access management. The project emphasized security best practices, including least-privilege access, automated administration via Bash and PowerShell scripts, and validation of directory services through structured testing. This lab reflects practical skills in system administration, security hardening, and infrastructure automation — core competencies for roles in cybersecurity, IT operations, and cloud administration.
